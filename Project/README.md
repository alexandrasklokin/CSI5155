This is my Project submission.

## Data

Contains original data, preprocessed data (cleaned and resampled), and test and training sets (unlabelled).

## Report

Contains files used to create the report (done in Overleaf), and the report itself. Also contains notebook to help produce report tables.

## Preprocessing

Contains notebooks for preprocessing the datasets.

## Tuning

Contains notebooks for supervised model selection (Self Training), and parameter tuning of Self Training and Label Propagation.

## Training

Contains notebooks for training of semi-supervised algorithms (Self Training, SemiBoost, and Label Propagation). Also contains my adaptation of the SemiBoost algorithm by github user papabloblo.

## Pred

Contains prediction results and metrics for classifiers.

## Evaluation

Contains notebooks for evaluating the models based on F1-Score, accuracy, and ROC curves. Also contains analysis of significant difference. Also contains my adaptation of the CD Diagram generator by github user hfawaz.

## ROC

Contains ROC curves.
